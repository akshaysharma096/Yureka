						<a href="#">About ACM<br></a>
						<p style="padding-bottom:64px">The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a non-for-profit international learned society for computing,headquartered in New York City and founded in 1947.It is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society.<br>
						<br>The ACM and the IEEE Computer Society are the umbrella organizations for US academic and scholarly interests in computing. Unlike the IEEE, the ACM is solely dedicated to computing. The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.Some of the major awards in Computer science are given jointly by ACM and the IEEEâ€“CS.</p>
